    "text": "What\nThis course will introduce biologists and bioinformaticians to the field of single-cell RNA sequencing. We will cover a range of software and analysis workflows that extend over the spectrum from the best practices in the filtering scRNA-seq data\nto the downstream analysis of cell clusters and temporal ordering. This course will help the attendees gain accurate insights in pre-processing, analysis and interpretation of scRNA-seq data.\nWe will start by introducing general concepts about single-cell RNA-sequencing. From there, we will then continue to describe the main analysis steps to go from raw sequencing data to processed and usable data. We will present classical analysis workflows, their output and the possible paths to investigate downstream of this.\nThroughout the workshop, bash tools and R/Bioconductor packages will be used to analyse datasets and learn new approaches."

The remainder of each day will consist in practical hands-on sessions focusing on analysis of scRNA-seq data. These sessions will involve a combination of both mirroring exercises with the instructor to demonstrate a skill, as well as applying these skills on your own to complete individual exercises.\nDuring and after each exercise, interpretation of results will be discussed as a group."

Basic bash commands (cd, ls, ...) and CLI usage will not be covered in this course. We advice attendees to not register if they lack fundamental experience in CLI.\nProgramming experience in R (writing a function, basic I/O operations, variable types, using packages). Bioconductor experience is a plus.\nFamiliarity with next-generation sequencing data and its analyses (using alignment and quantification tools for bulk sequencing data)"

    "text": "Rstudio offers a graphical interface to facilitate the interaction between a user and an underlying programming language (this is sometimes called IDE, or integrated development environment). It can be very useful when a user is not necessarily proficent with command line-based computing. However, such graphical interfaces are not always able to connect to services such as AWS.\nSince most of the preliminary analysis we do is on AWS, we’d like to be able to use Rtudio directly from there. To do that, simply go to the following address:\n\n\nhttp://54.191.190.243:8787\n\n\nDon’t forget, you can run a bash terminal from within RStudio! This may come handy if you want to process some data with cellranger, for example. To do this, simply click on the terminal button next on the bottom left panel. You should now be in your own ${home} directory (~)."

    "text": "3.1 Connect to RStudio Server\nMost of single-cell RNA-seq analysis takes place either in python or in R. Here, we focus on how to leverage R to investigate scRNAseq data. RStudio is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment, in other words: a nice graphical interface to run R-related commands).\nFor this workshop, we have installed R and RStudio on AWS. We can directly use RStudio (actually, RStudio-server since it is installed on an AWS remote server). Simply open a browser and copy-paste the following address:\n\n\nhttp://54.191.190.243:8787\n\n\nAn RStudio log in page will appear; to log in, use your user ID for both ID and password.\nNotice how when you log in Rstudio, there are multiple panels. Familiarize yourself with the different panels.\nThe interactive R console is generally found in the bottom left corner of RStudio(though it may be in another corner sometimes). All the rest (history panel, environment panel, directory explorer panel, editor panel) are extra features provided by RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome useful commands in R:\n\n\n\nWithin the R console, you can safely use R-dedicated commands. Do you know the most common ones? The semantics are a different from the terminal commands you may be used to…\n\n\n\nR\n\ngetwd() # equivalent of `pwd` in terminal\ndir.create('~/data/') # equivalent of `mkdir ~/data/` in terminal\nsetwd(\"~/data/\") # equivalent of `cd ~/data/` in terminal\nlist.files(\"~/data/\") # equivalent of `ls` in terminal\ndownload.file(\"...\") # equivalent of `wget ...` in terminal"

    "text": "3.2 Use a AWS terminal within RStudio\nA general issue with bioinformatic analyses stems from the fact that nobody works in the same environment:\n\nAre you working on Mac? Linux? Windows?\nDo you have a lot of computational power? Perhaps a GPU card?\nAre you connected to the Internet? With a fast connection? Are you working behind a proxy?\n\nTo ensure that we are all working in the same environment, we rely on AWS (Amazon Web Services) EC2 (Elastic Cloud 2) instances. EC2 instances are “virtual” computers to which you can connect remotely, from a local computer.\nThe instance is common for everybody. We are thus all sharing the same “computer”; this means:\n\nShared resources\nSame access to shared files\nSame access to system-wide softwares and conda environments\n\nThe easiest way for us to launch bash commands from a terminal in AWS is to do it through RStudio: You can open up a terminal directly from within RStudio as follow: go to Tools &gt; Terminal &gt; New terminal. This should open up a new tab in the bottom left corner (next to the R console).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR console versus terminal:\n\n\n\nFrom here onwards, be sure you completely understand the difference between “R console” and “terminal (or shell)”. They are entirely different things, and can be both accessed within RStudio. It is crucial you understand the difference between the two to not get confused for the rest of the course."

You generally will need the GEO corresponding ID or SRA project ID (e.g. SRPxxxxxx…).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nTry to install the ffq tool from the Patcher lab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling conda packages\n\n\n\nconda-based environments allow easy installs of packages such as ffq. Your (base) conda environment should be active by default, and you will only have to type:\n\npip install ffq\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nCheck ffq help and try fetching metadata for the GSE ID GSE148963.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbash\n\nffq --help\nffq -t GSE GSE148963 &gt; GSE148963_search.txt\nhead -n 30 GSE148963_search.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nCan you find the links to raw data associated with the GSE148963 GEO ID?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use a grep command: grep returns the lines which match a given pattern (e.g. a link…)!\n\n\n\nbash\n\ngrep 'ftp://' GSE148963_search.txt\n\n\nAnd with a bit of sed magick…\n\n\n\nbash\n\ngrep 'ftp://' GSE148963_search.txt | sed 's,.*ftp:,ftp:,' | sed 's,\".*,,' | grep \".fastq\" &gt; GSE148963_fastqlist.txt\n## `ffq` looks through GEO repository to fing metadata associated with the `GSE148963` entry (including downloading links)\n## grep 'ftp://' recovers the text lines that contain downloading links\n## the `sed` commands clean up the text lines\n## the `wget` command downloads locally the links listed in the generated file (GSE148963_fastqlist.txt)\n# wget -i GSE148963_fastqlist.txt ## Do not run, it would take too long...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nA subset of the reads has been downloaded and put in the ~/Share/ folder.

It’s way lighter than fastq reads, and you can go ahead with downstream analyses a lot quicker. So how do you get these matrices? Human Cell Atlas Consortium provides many processed datasets. For instance, in our case, the Leir et al study is available at the following link. GEO also hosts processed files.\n\nFind GEO-hosted processed files for the Leir et al study. \n\nYou can download some of the processed files available in GEO from the following webpage. Scrolling down to the bottom of the page, there is a box labelled “Supplementary data”. By clicking on “(custom)”, a list of extra supplementary files will appear.\n\nDownload and check the content of the count matrix, the genes and the barcodes files. \nWhat type of information does each file contain? How is it formatted? is it easily imported in R? \nHow many cells were sequenced? How many genes were counted? \nIs it easy to interpret the count matrix? Why is it in such format? \nComment on the file sizes between processed count matrix files and raw reads."

A dedicated workshop that I would recommend quickly going over is available here. Generally speaking, a SummarizedExperiment object contains matrix-like objects (the assays), with rows representing features (e.g. genes, transcripts, …) and each column representing a sample. Information specific to genes and samples are stored in “parallel” data frames, for example to store gene locations, tissue of expression, biotypes (for genes) or batch, generation date, or machine ID (for samples). On top of that, metadata are also stored in the object (to store description of a project, …).\nAn important difference with S3 list-like objects usually used in R is that most of the underlying data (organized in precisely structured \"slots\") is accessed using getter functions, rather than the familiar $ or [. Here are some important getters:\n\n\nassay(), assays(): Extrant matrix-like or list of matrix-like objects of identical dimensions. Since the objects are matrix-like, dim(), dimnames(), and 2-dimensional [, [&lt;- methods are available.\n\ncolData(): Annotations on each column (as a DataFrame): usually, description of each sample\n\nrowData(): Annotations on each row (as a DataFrame): usually, description of each gene\n\nmetadata(): List of unstructured metadata describing the overall content of the object.\n\nLet’s dig into an example (you may need to install the airway package from Bioconductor…)\n\n\n\nR\n\nlibrary(SummarizedExperiment)\n\n\nLoading required package: MatrixGenerics\n\n\nLoading required package: matrixStats\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'matrixStats'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    count\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'MatrixGenerics'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:matrixStats':\n\n    colAlls, colAnyNAs, colAnys, colAvgsPerRowSet, colCollapse, colCounts, colCummaxs, colCummins, colCumprods, colCumsums, colDiffs, colIQRDiffs, colIQRs, colLogSumExps,\n    colMadDiffs, colMads, colMaxs, colMeans2, colMedians, colMins, colOrderStats, colProds, colQuantiles, colRanges, colRanks, colSdDiffs, colSds, colSums2, colTabulates,\n    colVarDiffs, colVars, colWeightedMads, colWeightedMeans, colWeightedMedians, colWeightedSds, colWeightedVars, rowAlls, rowAnyNAs, rowAnys, rowAvgsPerColSet, rowCollapse,\n    rowCounts, rowCummaxs, rowCummins, rowCumprods, rowCumsums, rowDiffs, rowIQRDiffs, rowIQRs, rowLogSumExps, rowMadDiffs, rowMads, rowMaxs, rowMeans2, rowMedians, rowMins,\n    rowOrderStats, rowProds, rowQuantiles, rowRanges, rowRanks, rowSdDiffs, rowSds, rowSums2, rowTabulates, rowVarDiffs, rowVars, rowWeightedMads, rowWeightedMeans,\n    rowWeightedMedians, rowWeightedSds, rowWeightedVars\n\n\nLoading required package: GenomicRanges\n\n\nLoading required package: stats4\n\n\nLoading required package: BiocGenerics\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'BiocGenerics'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:lubridate':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, union\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    combine, intersect, setdiff, union\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    IQR, mad, sd, var, xtabs\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    anyDuplicated, aperm, append, as.data.frame, basename, cbind, colnames, dirname, do.call, duplicated, eval, evalq, Filter, Find, get, grep, grepl, intersect, is.unsorted,\n    lapply, Map, mapply, match, mget, order, paste, pmax, pmax.int, pmin, pmin.int, Position, rank, rbind, Reduce, rownames, sapply, setdiff, table, tapply, union, unique,\n    unsplit, which.max, which.min\n\n\nLoading required package: S4Vectors\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'S4Vectors'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:lubridate':\n\n    second, second&lt;-\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    first, rename\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tidyr':\n\n    expand\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:utils':\n\n    findMatches\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    expand.grid, I, unname\n\n\nLoading required package: IRanges\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'IRanges'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:lubridate':\n\n    %within%\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    collapse, desc, slice\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    reduce\n\n\nLoading required package: GenomeInfoDb\n\n\nLoading required package: Biobase\n\n\nWelcome to Bioconductor\n\n    Vignettes contain introductory material; view with 'browseVignettes()'.

It is primarily developed and maintained by the Sajita Lab. It originally begun as a single package aiming at encompassing “all” (most) aspects of scRNAseq analysis. However, it rapidly evolved in a much larger project, and now operates along with other “wrappers” and extensions. It also has a very extended support from the lab group. All in all, is provides a (somewhat) simple workflow to start investigating scRNAseq data.\nIt is important to chose one standard that you feel comfortable with yourself. Which standard provides the most intuitive approach for you? Do you prefer an “all-in-one, plug-n-play” workflow (Seurat-style), or a modular approach (Bioconductor-style)? Which documentation is easier to read for you, a central full-featured website with extensive examples (Seurat-style), or “programmatic”-style vignettes (Bioconductor-style)?\nThis course will mostly rely on Bioconductor-based methods, but sometimes use Seurat-based methods.s In the absence of coordination of data structures, the next best solution is to write functions to coerce an object from a certain class to another class (i.e. Seurat to SingleCellExperiment, or vice-versa). Luckily, this is quite straightforward in R for these 2 data classes:\n\n\n\nR\n\nsce_seurat &lt;- Seurat::as.Seurat(sce)\n\n\nWarning: Keys should be one or more alphanumeric characters followed by an underscore, setting key from DC to DC_\n\nsce\n\nclass: SingleCellExperiment \ndim: 500 1920 \nmetadata(0):\nassays(2): counts logcounts\nrownames(500): ENSMUSG00000076609 ENSMUSG00000021250 ...

    "text": "7.1 Introduction\nData produced in a single cell RNA-seq experiment has several interesting characteristics that make it distinct from data produced in a bulk population RNA-seq experiment.\nTwo characteristics that are important to keep in mind when working with scRNA-Seq are drop-out (the excessive amount of zeros due to limiting mRNA) and the potential for quality control (QC) metrics to be confounded with biology. This combined with the ability to measure heterogeniety from cells in samples has shifted the field away from the typical analysis in population-based RNA-Seq.\nHere we demonstrate some approaches to quality control, followed by identifying and analyzing cell subsets.\n\n7.1.1 Load necessary packages\nWhen loading libraries, we are asking R to load code for us written by someone else.

We will now create a toy SingleCellExperiment object from scratch, using the SingleCellExperiment constructor.\nTo create a SingleCellExperiment object, we need to provide the following:\n\n\ncolData: a data frame (or tibble) with columns corresponding to cell metadata.\n\nrowData: a data frame (or tibble) with columns corresponding to gene metadata.\n\nassays: a list of matrices, each matrix corresponding to a different assay. The first matrix is typically the counts matrix.\n\n\n\n\nR\n\ncd &lt;- tibble(idx = paste0('cell', 1:100))  ## `cd` stands for colData\ncd\n\n\n# A tibble: 100 × 1\n   idx   \n   &lt;chr&gt; \n 1 cell1 \n 2 cell2 \n 3 cell3 \n 4 cell4 \n 5 cell5 \n 6 cell6 \n 7 cell7 \n 8 cell8 \n 9 cell9 \n10 cell10\n# ℹ 90 more rows\n\nrd &lt;- tibble(\n    gene_name = paste0('gene', 1:10),\n    gene_type = factor(rep(c('protein_coding', 'non_coding'), each = 5))\n) ## `rd` stands for rowData\nrd \n\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   gene_name gene_type     \n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;         \n 1 gene1     protein_coding\n 2 gene2     protein_coding\n 3 gene3     protein_coding\n 4 gene4     protein_coding\n 5 gene5     protein_coding\n 6 gene6     non_coding    \n 7 gene7     non_coding    \n 8 gene8     non_coding    \n 9 gene9     non_coding    \n10 gene10    non_coding    \n\ncnts &lt;- matrix(rpois(1000, 5), ncol = 100) ## `cnts` stands for counts\n\ndim(cd)\n\n[1] 100   1\n\ndim(rd)\n\n[1] 10  2\n\ndim(cnts)\n\n[1]  10 100\n\nnrow(cd) == ncol(cnts)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nnrow(rd) == nrow(cnts)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\ntoy_sce &lt;- SingleCellExperiment(\n    colData = cd, \n    rowData = rd, \n    assays = list('counts' = cnts)\n)\ntoy_sce\n\nclass: SingleCellExperiment \ndim: 10 100 \nmetadata(0):\nassays(1): counts\nrownames: NULL\nrowData names(2): gene_name gene_type\ncolnames: NULL\ncolData names(1): idx\nreducedDimNames(0):\nmainExpName: NULL\naltExpNames(0):\n\ncolData(toy_sce)\n\nDataFrame with 100 rows and 1 column\n            idx\n    &lt;character&gt;\n1         cell1\n2         cell2\n3         cell3\n4         cell4\n5         cell5\n...         ...\n96       cell96\n97       cell97\n98       cell98\n99       cell99\n100     cell100\n\nrowData(toy_sce)\n\nDataFrame with 10 rows and 2 columns\n     gene_name      gene_type\n   &lt;character&gt;       &lt;factor&gt;\n1        gene1 protein_coding\n2        gene2 protein_coding\n3        gene3 protein_coding\n4        gene4 protein_coding\n5        gene5 protein_coding\n6        gene6 non_coding    \n7        gene7 non_coding    \n8        gene8 non_coding    \n9        gene9 non_coding    \n10      gene10 non_coding    \n\nassays(toy_sce)\n\nList of length 1\nnames(1): counts\n\nassays(toy_sce)[[\"counts\"]][1:10, 1:10]\n\n      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10]\n [1,]   11    3    5    2    6    3    6    3   11     3\n [2,]    8    1    6    4    5    5    3    5    6     4\n [3,]    7    9    4    3    6    5    7    6    5     3\n [4,]    2    4    4    7    6    4    4    6    3     5\n [5,]    3    3    5    5    4    4    4    7    4     9\n [6,]    5    7    6    6    8    6    5    5    5     5\n [7,]    7    7    4    4    4    5    1    4    6     6\n [8,]    5    0    5    5    4    7    5    4    4     4\n [9,]    4    3    7    5    3    6    4    4    5     6\n[10,]    5    3    2    4    5    2    4    4    2     2\n\n\n\n7.1.3 Read in Pancreas counts matrix.\nWe will now analyze a real human pancreas scRNAseq dataset.

One can use such plot to investigate observations (potential cells) that are actually failed libraries (lower end outliers) or observations that are cell doublets (higher end outliers).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nPlot cells ranked by their number of detected genes.

This has the advantage that we do not need to keep track of inidividual variables of interest - they can all be collapsed into a single object as long as these slots are pre-defined.\n\n7.4.2 Filtering low-quality cells: mitochondrial counts\nFor each cell, we can calculate the percentage of counts mapping on mitochondrial genes and store it in a column percent_mito in our colData().\n\n\n\nR\n\nrowData(sce_filtered)\n\n\nDataFrame with 16606 rows and 2 columns\n                   X1            X2\n          &lt;character&gt;   &lt;character&gt;\n1     ENSG00000279457    FO538757.2\n2     ENSG00000228463    AP006222.2\n3     ENSG00000237094 RP4-669L17.10\n4     ENSG00000237491 RP11-206L10.9\n5     ENSG00000225880     LINC00115\n...               ...           ...\n16602 ENSG00000198727        MT-CYB\n16603 ENSG00000276256    AC011043.1\n16604 ENSG00000273748    AL592183.1\n16605 ENSG00000278817    AC007325.4\n16606 ENSG00000271254    AC240274.1\n\nmito_genes &lt;- rownames(sce_filtered)[grep(pattern = \"^MT-\", x = rowData(sce_filtered)$X2)]\nmito_genes_counts &lt;- counts(sce_filtered)[mito_genes, ]\npercent_mito &lt;- colSums(mito_genes_counts) / sce_filtered$total\nhist(percent_mito*100, main = '% of total counts over mitochondrial genes', col = 'wheat')\n\n\n\ncolData(sce_filtered)$percent_mito &lt;- percent_mito\ntable(colData(sce_filtered)$percent_mito &gt; 0.1)\n\n\nFALSE \n 1419 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nRemove cells with a % of mitochondrial counts greater than 10%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n\nsce_filtered &lt;- sce_filtered[\n    , \n    sce_filtered$percent_mito &lt;= 0.10\n]\nsce_filtered\n\n\nclass: SingleCellExperiment \ndim: 16606 1419 \nmetadata(0):\nassays(2): counts logcounts\nrownames: NULL\nrowData names(2): X1 X2\ncolnames(1419): AAACCTGAGGCTCATT-1 AAACCTGAGGTGCACA-1 ...

These genes reflect commomn processes active in a cell and hence are a good global quality measure. They are also abundant and are usually steadliy expressed in cells, thus less sensitive to the high dropout.\nWe first load the list of housekeeping genes (from ~/Share/tirosh_house_keeping.txt), match them to the genes in the rowData of the SingleCellExperiment object (using match and rownames), remove NAs (genes not found in the rowData), and store the list of housekeeping genes in a new variable.\n\n\n\nR\n\n# Load the list of housekeeping genes\nhkgenes &lt;- read.table(\"~/Share/tirosh_house_keeping.txt\", skip = 2)\nhkgenes &lt;- as.vector(hkgenes$V1)\nhkgenes &lt;- rownames(sce_filtered)[match(hkgenes, rowData(sce_filtered)$X2)]\nhkgenes &lt;- hkgenes[!is.na(hkgenes)]\nhkgenes\n\n\nNULL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nCalculate the number of expressed housekeeping genes per cell (genes with a count &gt; 0) and store the number of expressed housekeeping genes per cell in colData.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n\ncolData(sce_filtered)$n_expressed_hkgenes &lt;- Matrix::colSums(counts(sce_filtered)[hkgenes, ] &gt; 0)\ntable(colData(sce_filtered)$n_expressed_hkgenes)\n\n\n\n   0 \n1419 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nPlot (in a boxplot) the relationship between the # of detected housekeeping genes and the total UMI count (or # of detected genes) per cell.

This set of genes may make up a gene expression program we are interested in. Another benefit at looking at gene sets is it reduces the effects of drop outs.\nLet’s look at genes involved in the stress signature upon cell dissociation. We calculate these genes average expression levels on the single cell level.\n\n\n\nR\n\ngenes_dissoc &lt;- c(\"ATF3\", \"BTG2\", \"CEBPB\", \"CEBPD\", \"CXCL3\", \"CXCL2\", \"CXCL1\", \"DNAJA1\", \"DNAJB1\", \"DUSP1\", \"EGR1\", \"FOS\", \"FOSB\", \"HSP90AA1\", \"HSP90AB1\", \"HSPA1A\", \"HSPA1B\", \"HSPA1A\", \"HSPA1B\", \"HSPA8\", \"HSPB1\", \"HSPE1\", \"HSPH1\", \"ID3\", \"IER2\", \"JUN\", \"JUNB\", \"JUND\", \"MT1X\", \"NFKBIA\", \"NR4A1\", \"PPP1R15A\", \"SOCS3\", \"ZFP36\")\ngenes_dissoc &lt;- rownames(sce_filtered)[match(genes_dissoc, rowData(sce_filtered)$X2)]\ngenes_dissoc &lt;- unique(genes_dissoc[!is.na(genes_dissoc)])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nCalculate the average gene set expression for each cell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n\nave_expr_genes_dissoc &lt;- colMeans(logcounts(sce_filtered[genes_dissoc, ]))\ncolData(sce_filtered)$ave_expr_genes_dissoc &lt;- ave_expr_genes_dissoc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nPlot an embedding of the dataset, using a color scale representing the average expression of genes involved in the stress signature upon cell dissociation.

We can define the library size as the total sum of counts across all genes for each cell, the expected value of which is assumed to scale with any cell-specific biases. However, this relies on the assumption that within the entire dataset, most genes are non-differentially expressed and expressed roughly within the same range. Depending on the set up of the scRNAseq experiment, this can be entirely false. To avoid relying on this hypothesis, we can (1) quickly pre-cluster cells, then (2) normalize cells using their library size factor separately in each cluster, then (3) rescaling size factors so that they are comparable across clusters.\nAll of this can be done very simply using the combo quickCluster() + computeSumFactors() + logNormCounts() from scran/scuttle packages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nWhat is the purpose of the quickCluster() function?

Procedures like clustering and dimensionality reduction compare cells based on their gene expression profiles. The choice of genes to include in this comparison may have a major impact on the performance of downstream methods. Ideally, one wants to only select genes that contain useful information about the biology of the system while removing genes that contain random noise. This aims to preserve interesting biological structure without the variance that obscures that structure.\nThe simplest approach to feature selection is to compute the variance of the log-normalized expression values, to select the most variable genes.

    "text": "9.2 Clustering\nClustering is an unsupervised learning procedure that is used in scRNA-seq data analysis to empirically define groups of cells with similar expression profiles. Its primary purpose is to summarize the data in a digestible format for human interpretation.\nAfter annotation based on marker genes, the clusters can be treated as proxies for more abstract biological concepts such as cell types or states. Clustering is thus a critical step for extracting biological insights from scRNA-seq data.\n\n9.2.1 Clustering algorithms\nThree main approaches can be used:\n\nHierarchical clustering\nk-means clustering\nGraph-based clustering\n\nToday, we will focus on graph-based clustering, as it is becoming the standard for scRNAseq: it is a flexible and scalable technique for clustering even the largest scRNA-seq datasets. We first build a graph where each node is a cell that is connected by edges to its nearest neighbors in the high-dimensional space. Edges are weighted based on the similarity between the cells involved, with higher weight given to cells that are more closely related.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nCompute a graph-based clustering of the PBMC dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n\ngraph &lt;- scran::buildSNNGraph(\n    sce, \n    k = 5, \n    use.dimred = 'PCA'\n)\nsce_clust &lt;- igraph::cluster_louvain(graph)$membership\nsce$clusters_graph &lt;- factor(sce_clust)\ntable(sce$clusters_graph)\n\n\n\n  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17 \n502 359 682  40 129 393  61 193 349 363 376 218 190 151 127 197  10 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nWhat are the main parameters to choose when building the graph?

    "text": "15.2 Trajectory inference (TI) in scRNAseq\nAn important question in scRNAseq field of research is: how to identify a cell trajectory from high-dimensional expression data and map individual cells onto it? A large number of methods have currently emerged, each one with their own specificities, assumptions, and strengths. A nice breakdown (from 2019, so already very outdated!) is available from Saelens et al., Nat. Biotech. 2018 (doi: 10.1038/s41587-019-0071-9):\n\n\n15.2.1 Trajectory\nSlingshot is perhaps one of the most widely used algorithms for users who want to focus on R-based approaches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nRead Slingshot documentation to understand how to identify lineages in a scRNAseq dataset in R.\nWhy is it recommended to infer lineages from PCA space rather than t-SNE or UMAP space, even though these spaces do “reveal” an obvious trajectory in 2D?\nInfer lineages, using cluster annotations as information to build the MST. Note that you will first need to remove the 50th PCA dimension for slingshot to work (bug reported).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n\nreducedDim(germcells, 'corrected_2') &lt;- reducedDim(germcells, 'corrected')[, 1:49]\ngermcells_slingshot &lt;- slingshot::slingshot(\n    germcells, \n    reducedDim = 'corrected_2', \n    clusterLabels = germcells$annotation\n)\nslingshot::slingLineages(germcells_slingshot)\n\n\n$Lineage1\n[1] \"Late spermatids\"  \"Early spermatids\" \"Spermatocytes\"    \"Spermatogonia\"   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15.2.2 Pseudotime\nslingshot automatically deduces a pseudotime for each cell, based on the inferred lineage.
